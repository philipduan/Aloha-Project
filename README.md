# Aloha-Project

Aloha Apparel - RED ACADEMY

Project Summary

This is the first part of the first project completed as a part of RED ACADEMY's front-end web developer program. Our goal is to adequately reflect the designer's vision for the website and demonstrate effective organization of the project's root directory.

Languages and tools used:

HTML CSS (with a CSS reset styles, and media queries Mobile first approach to design & coding (Responsive Web Design) Git JQuery flexboxes

What did I learn?

This project is my first opportunity to exercise the HTML and CSS skills taught throughout the first week of web development training. Having comppleted using flexbox for responsive design gave me a greater appreciation of the functionality. Also, I learned how relativly easy it is to use jQuery plug-ins to achieve certain results.
