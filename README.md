## Summary

For our first project at Red Academy we built the homepage of an e-commerce website, Aloha Apparel, using HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. 

## Languages and Tools Used

	* HTML5
	* CSS3 (CSS reset styles, flexbox, css grid and media queries)
	* jQuery (smooth scrolling, bxSlider, DOM navigation)
	* Git and Github 
	* Mobile first approach to coding & design
	

## Personal Learning

	* Handle background image efficiently by changing the positioning, layering, and sizing propreties of elements
	* Approach the project with Mobile First for the design
