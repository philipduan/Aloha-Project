# Project 1 - Aloha Apparel

http://www.philipdu.com/Aloha-Project/

## Summary

For our first project at Red Academy we built the homepage of an e-commerce website, Aloha Apparel, using HTML5, CSS3, and jQuery. 

## Languages and Tools Used

	* HTML5
	* CSS3 (CSS reset styles, flexbox, css grid and media queries)
	* jQuery (smooth scrolling, bxSlider, DOM navigation)
	* Git and Github 
	* Mobile first approach to coding & design
	

## Learning

For this project I was able to learn and improve my HTML, CSS, and jQuery skills. At first using these mark-ups and languages proved to be a bit of a challenge. However,  with time and plenty of practice I was able to improve upon what I've learned, to the point where I am able to say that I am very confident in my skills with these languages.
